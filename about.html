<p> Hi! My name is Heather Barton and I am the name behind Flutter Creative. Just like most, I started my college career not really knowing what I wanted to do with my life. I stumbled around and took several classes. I knew I loved art so always made sure I had an art class each semester. My big moment is in my 2D class and my teach said you should look into graphic design. I decided to take her advice and switched schools. This changed everything for me!
