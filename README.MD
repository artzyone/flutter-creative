About the project:

I wanted something to showcase some of the photos I have done as well as have a brief about page and a contact page. 

On the smaller screen size I made sure the lightbox function would not work and the images were all in a single column layout to make it easier to look at.

On the larger screen they are all in a row so you can see them all at once and the lightbox feature is enabled.
